## FAQ

### Why would i ever need Trojan's or Ransomware?

Fun. Viruses can be the most fun thing. Destroying a virtual machine and seeing how they work are interesting.

### Are the files safe?

They are not safe. All the files you can download here are Viruses. <br/>
Use a Virtual Machine without network connection to play around with them and never run them on a real pc<br/>

### Password for Unzipping?

The password is **SpecZDB**

### How often do you update the Database?

I don't know. When i find new files i'll upload them once tested.

### Do you accept malware requests?

I will maybe do this in the future but currently i am not.

### The Virus dosn't work correctly. What am i doing wrong?

Most of the time you are using the wrong version of Windows.<br/>
Most of the viruses run on Windows 10. Updates can break the viruses.<br/>

### BATCH FILES AND VBS FILES ARENT EVEN VIRUSES LMAOOOOOOOOOOOO

The .BAT and .VBS are virues and will destroy your system.<br/>
I'm storing these here since they have interesting payloads and mostly corrupt the whole operating system.<br/>

### Who is this other Author called Xanex?

He writes and tests viruses aswell as Aspect. <br/>
We both don't earn money from doing this thats why it dosn't get updated often.<br/>



## Virtual Machine Setup

### Windows

#### 1. Install a Virtual Machine Emulator 
Recommendations:

- [Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/) [Fully Free]
- [VMware](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player.html) [Half Paid]

#### 2. Create a Machine with your specified operating system.
Most of the viruses run on:

- Windows 10
- Windows 11
- Windows 8
- Windows 7

#### 3. Download the File onto the Machine.

If you dont know how to do this then you shouldnt even do it

#### 4. Dissable your Internet Connection on the Machine and any Host to Guest connection

On the Virtual Machine Emulator just disconnect the Virtual Machine Adapter or turn it fully off.<br/>
Some Virues might spread over the network so its important to do this step.<br/>
Shared Folders, Shared Clipboard or Drag and Drop should be turned off.<br/>

#### 5. Run it.

Once you feel ready. Run the file. If you don't feel safe, extra check your Virtual Machine settings.
